## 🧪 How to Test Locally

### Step 1: Start Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 2: Open Two Browser Tabs
```
Tab 1: http://localhost:3001
Tab 2: http://localhost:3001 (incognito/private window)
```

### Step 3: Test Chat Flow

**Tab 1:**
1. Click "Start"
2. Allow camera/mic
3. Wait for match...
4. **Chat input should activate** (gray background → darker, not disabled)

**Tab 2:**
1. Click "Start"
2. Allow camera/mic
3. **Both tabs match!**
4. **Chat activates in both tabs**

### Step 4: Send Messages

**Tab 1:**
- Type: "Hello!"
- Press Enter (or click 📤)
- **Should appear as blue bubble on right**

**Tab 2:**
- **Should see "Hello!" as gray bubble on left**
- Type: "Hi there!"
- Press Enter
- **Should appear as blue bubble on right**

**Tab 1:**
- **Should see "Hi there!" as gray bubble on left**

✅ **Chat works!**

### Step 5: Test Chat Clearing

**In either tab:**
- Click "Next" button
- **Chat clears** (shows "Start a conversation" again)
- New match happens
- **Chat re-enables** (empty, ready for new conversation)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Chat input is still grayed out/disabled"

**Check:**
1. Are you matched? (should see stranger's video)
2. Browser console (F12 → Console) - any errors?
3. Is `enableChat()` being called?

**Debug:**
- Open browser console
- Type: `chatInput.disabled`
- Should show `false` when connected
- If `true`, chat is disabled

**Manual fix (console):**
```javascript
chatInput.disabled = false;
chatSendBtn.disabled = false;
```

### Issue: "Messages not appearing"

**Check:**
1. Server logs - do you see `[CHAT]` messages?
2. Both tabs matched in same room?
3. Network tab - are messages being sent?

**Server logs should show:**
```
[CHAT] Message from abc123 to def456: "Hello!"
```

### Issue: "Can't type after pressing Enter"

**Solution:** Working as designed!
- Enter = Send message
- Shift+Enter = New line
