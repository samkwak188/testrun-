# 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **1. Connection Not Ending Properly** ✅
**Problem:** When user disconnected, it still showed "Connected"

**Fix:**
- Added proper cleanup of remote video stream tracks
- Stop all media tracks on disconnect
- Clear peer connection completely
- Reset all state variables (roomId, peerId, isConnected)
- Update UI to correct state

**Result:** Disconnections now work properly - shows correct status immediately

---

### **2. Chat Input Not Visible/Working** ✅
**Problem:** Chat input box wasn't showing or was blocked

**Fixes:**
- Made chat input area sticky at bottom of chat panel
- Increased input padding and min-height (42px)
- Better visual feedback when focused
- Fixed disabled state styling
- Proper placeholder text visibility

**Result:** Chat input is now clearly visible and functional

---

### **3. Auto-Hide Control Bar** ✅
**Feature:** Controls slide down after 10 seconds of inactivity

**Implementation:**
- Control bar hides automatically after 10 seconds
- Shows again when you move mouse over video area
- Shows again when you touch screen (mobile)
- Always visible when idle/not connected
- Smooth slide animation

**Result:** More screen space for videos when chatting

---

### **4. Chat Column Full Height** ✅
**Problem:** Control bar was blocking chat input

**Fix:**
- Control bar now excludes chat column (only covers video area)
- Chat column spans full height from top to bottom
- Chat input always visible and accessible
- No overlap with controls

**Result:** Chat is never blocked by controls

---

### **5. Allow Users Without Camera** ✅
**Problem:** Camera was required, users without camera couldn't join

**Fix:**
- Try camera + mic first
- Fallback to audio-only if camera fails/denied
- Show alert: "You can still join with audio only"
- Users can participate with just microphone

**Result:** More inclusive - works even without camera
